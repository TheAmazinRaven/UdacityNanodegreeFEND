## Udacity Front End Nanodegree

I began this Nanodegree sometime in January as I was lucky enough to be a scholarship recipient of [OneTen](https://oneten.org/) and [BlacksInTech](https://www.blacksintechnology.net/).

I wanted to document my journey as I learn Front End Development fundamentals while also dipping my toes in the cloud.

(Setting up this environment was so complicated but that's another story for another day, lol.)

Anyway, since I have this set up now, I might try to log my progress here.
