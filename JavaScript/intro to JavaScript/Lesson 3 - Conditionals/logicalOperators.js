/* && is a logical operator for AND; it's used to combine two logical expressions into one larger expression.

If both expressions are true, then the entire expression evaluates to true.

If either of these are false, then the whole logical expression is false.

When you apply the ! operator to a boolean value, the ! returns true if the value is false and returns false if the value if true.
